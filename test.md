# Project Testing

## How User Stories Were Tested:
*As a game player, I want clear navigation so that I can quickly access what I need, i.e how to play or a different level.*
- Both web pages have clearly labelled buttons for users and the game page also has an icon section. The game landing page displays a clear panel of buttons.
*As a game player, I want to be able to have control over any audio on the site.*
- On the landing page there is a button to toggle on and off the music, when the user has moved on to the game page they have the option to control the sound by clicking the "Speaker" icon.
*As a game player, I want to be able to access how to play the game at any time.*
-  The landing page displays a button labelled how to play, when the user has moved on to the game page there is an "information" icon which allows them to access the how to play modal if needed.*
*As a game player, I want to see bright eye-catching visual images which add to my experience.*
-I created all the images for the game board cards using canva.com and ensured I was bright colours that complimented the game page background
*As a game player, I want to be able to see how I am doing in the game: how many moves i've made and how long it has taken me
- Above the game board is a scoreboard section which enables the user to see the time elapsed since they made the first move in the game along with the number of moves they made. 
*As a game player, I want to be able to easily refresh the game at any time.*
*As a game player, I want to be able to receive a hint if I am struggling with the game. *
- The buttons panel above the game board allows users to click a hint button which flashes the cards on the board for 600 milliseconds. The number of hints allowed in the game varies on whatever level the user has picked. 

## How Responsiveness Was Tested
The responsiveness of the web game was tested by using [amiresponsive.is](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/). Image results below:

## How JS was tested:
I tested the JS for this project by creating a javascript file called debug.js which held some key testing functions outlined below:
